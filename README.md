This  package extends the Swim HTML DSL with syntax sugar for HTMX.

**Note: This package is WIP. It's not complete and not everything is properly considered. Please refrain from using it in prod for the time being. BTW, PRs welcome!**

HTMX defines new HTML tag attributes to allow any tag to issue network calls and swap only a part or parts of the website with the received response. It opens the possibility to create rich web experiences driven from the backend and removes the need for browser-side frameworks such as React or Angular in most use cases.

SwimHTMX combines the HTMX tags in several functions for ease of use in Swim.

In the following example of a Vapor controller, the `htmxAction` function is applied to a button defining:
- the endpoint called then the button is clicked
- the tag which contents will be replaced with the response
as well as disabling the button for the duration of the call.

The `GET /emoji` endpoint simply responds with a random emoji text (which is valid HTML) and the contents of the <div id:"emoji"> is replaced with it.

```Swift
struct EmojiController: RouteCollection {

    func boot(routes: RoutesBuilder) throws {
        routes.get("", use: home)
        routes.get("emoji", use: getEmoji)
    }

    func home(req: Request) -> Node {

        html {
            head {
                meta(charset: "utf-8")
                meta(content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", name: "viewport")
                script(src: "https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10")
                link(href: "css/style.css", rel: "stylesheet")
            }
            body {
                div(class: "center-screen") {

                    div(id: "emoji") { "ðŸ™‚" }

                    button { "Emoji" }.htmxAction(endpoint: .get(path: "/emoji"),
                                                  target: .id("emoji"),
                                                  disable: .this)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    func getEmoji(req: Request) async throws -> Node {
        Node.text(String(randomEmoji()))
    }
}
```

The home page is rendered into the following HTML. You can see the HTMX attributes rendered.

```HTML
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8"/>
		<meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" name="viewport"/>
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10">
		</script>
		<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="center-screen">
			<div id="emoji">
				ðŸ™‚
			</div>
			<button hx-disabled-elt="this" hx-get="/emoji" hx-swap="innerHTML" hx-target="#emoji">
				Emoji
			</button>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```
And that's the result:
